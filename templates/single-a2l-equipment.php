							The Environmental Protection Agency has issued a new rule restricting the use of High GWP refrigerants (HFCs) in HVAC and Refrigerant Equipment. This means that the current refrigerant is being phased out and replaced with two new more globally friendly substitutes. Along with the new refrigerant changes your equipment will also experience a change. Most important of the changes is there is a no sell-through date, for all regions, of current R-410A HVAC equipment. Additionally, are three important aspects that you will need to know about this new rule.

					With the new Technology Transition Rule, the EPA has designated that refrigerants must phase down the use of Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) to meet the new GWP (Global Warming Potential) level. To reduce HFCs the EPA has designated that refrigerants must meet a new GWP (Global Warming Potential) of 700. The current refrigerant R-410A has a GWP of 2088 and does not meet the new GWP level.

					Additionally, these refrigerants have a new classification, A2L. The A2L classification denotes a mild flammability, which will change how these refrigerants will need to be handled.  *NOTE: A2L- Although Mildly Flammable are extremely difficult to ignite and have low flame speed. 2L refrigerants have a burning velocity of 10 cm/s (3.9 inches per second) or less, making them less likely to sustain combustion after the initial ignition source has been removed.

								<h3 class="">The Technology Transition Rule: Transitions and Restrictions</h3>
								<p class="">
									The Technology Transition’s final rule restricts the manufacture and import of certain refrigeration, air conditioning, and heat pump (RACHP) products and the installation of certain RACHP systems. There is now a full system installation prohibition after January 1, 2025, this affects all regions. Along with these restriction certain HVAC products have been regrouped into three new classifications.
								</p>
								<p>
									There are now three classifications of HVAC systems: Products, Systems and Components.
								</p>
								<ul>
									<li>
									A product is functional upon leaving a factory. A product is a type of appliance with a sealed refrigerant loop that simply needs to be plugged in, mounted, or hooked to a water line, to work. For example, window air conditioning units, residential dehumidifiers, packaged terminal air conditioners, commercial freezers, and vending machines are examples of products. If you need a heating, ventilation, and air conditioning technician to assemble and/or charge with refrigerant, it’s not a product. EPA is restricting the sale, distribution, and export of products containing higher-GWP HFCs three years after the manufacture/import restriction dates. Products will have a sell-through for three years until January 1, 2028.
									</li>

									<li>
									A system is assembled from multiple components and charged on site. A system for purposes of the Technology Transitions Program is an assemblage of separate components constituting the refrigerant loop that typically are connected and charged with refrigerant in the field. If you need a heating, ventilation, and air conditioning technician to assemble and/or charge with refrigerant, it’s a system. Examples include supermarkets with centralized compressor rooms and mini-split air conditioners. Full systems have an installation prohibition after January 1, 2025.
									</li>

									<li>
									Components are described as pieces of equipment that must be assembled into a larger system to function. For purposes of the Technology Transitions Program, five components are specifically identified: compressors, condensing units or condensers, and evaporator units or evaporators. 
									<br>
									<div class="a2l_note">
										<small>
											*NOTE: Components are not subject to the same restrictions as “products.” Where the rules use “specified component” means condensing units, condensers, compressors, evaporator units and evaporators. Refrigerant tubing and thermal expansion valves are excluded from the requirements of the rule. Electronics, fan motors, ducts, and other parts outside the refrigerant loop are also excluded from the requirements of the rule. EPA does not restrict the manufacture, import, sale, distribution, or export of components that are used to repair existing RACHP systems.

								<h3 class="">The Technology Transition Rule: New Products and Mitigation</h3>
									<p class="">
									Because of the low flammability of A2L refrigerants, equipment manufacturers will be re-designing their (RACHP) systems based around mitigation requirements. Mitigation is now required in the event of a refrigerant leak. To meet these new requirements manufacturers will design their systems with added mitigation leak detection systems, including leak sensors, control boards, and intrinsically safe electrical components.<br>
									*Intrinsically safe components, contactors, capacitors, etc., are designed to be enclosed, isolating the electrical contacts form the atmosphere. 
									</p>
							</div>




							<div class="col-12 col-lg-11 pt-3">
								<h3 class="">How do these new systems work to mitigate refrigerant leaks? </h3>
									<p class="">
									Although the new A2L refrigerants are difficult to ignite, mitigation is still needed. The new leak sensors and controls boards will work together to shut down the system in case of refrigerant leak. If a leak is detected the sensor will communicate with the control board to shut down the system and turn on the blower to dissipate any refrigerant, while the sensors notify the homeowner. The leak sensors will be in the indoor coil cabinet while the mitigation board will be installed in the furnace. * Mitigation components will be factory installed on new A2L refrigerant equipment, but field installed mitigation equipment will be available. <br>
									*Designs and placement of mitigation control board and leak sensors may vary by brand, but the mitigation requirements and function are the same.

								<h3 class="">The Technology Transition Rule: Quick Facts</h3>
								<h4>If I leave the existing refrigerant lines but replace the condensing unit and indoor coil, is it a new system?</h4>
									<p class="">
									Yes. Refrigerant lines are generally not removed when replacing the other mechanical components of a system. Therefore, even if refrigerant lines are unchanged, replacing all the other components would result in a new system for purposes of the Technology Transitions Program.
									</p>
							</div>




							<div class="col-12 col-lg-11 pt-5">
								<h4>When do the restrictions take effect?</h4>
									<p class="">
									Manufacture and import compliance dates vary depending on the subsector, ranging from January 1, 2025, to January 1, 2028. Restriction on sales, distribution, and export of products apply three years after the sector/subsector manufacture and import compliance dates, to allow for a sell-through period of previously manufactured or imported products.
Manufacturers and importers of products and systems that use HFCs will be subject to requirements for labeling, annual reporting, and recordkeeping. The labeling requirements take effect on the same date as the manufacture and import compliance date for each subsector. The reporting and recordkeeping requirements for all subsectors covered by this rule begin on January 1, 2025. Reference the Technology Transitions HFC Restrictions by Sector and/or final rule for more detailed information.

							<div class="col-12 col-lg-11 pt-5">
								<h4>My R-410A unitary air conditioner condensing unit broke. Do I need to buy a whole new system with the lower GWP refrigerant, or can I replace the faulty component?</h4>
									<p class="">
									Homeowners can maintain and repair their systems throughout the useful life of the equipment. A homeowner can replace a faulty component (e.g., condensing unit, indoor coil, other smaller parts) with a similar R-410A component. After January 1, 2025, if a whole new system is installed it must use lower GWP refrigerant.
									</p>
							</div>




							<div class="col-12 col-lg-11 pt-5">
								<h4>What is a new system?</h4>
									<p class="">
									For residential air conditioner split systems, a new system would be installed in a newly constructed home. A new system would also be installed if both the condensing unit and indoor coil are replaced together. The condensing unit contains the condenser coil and compressor and the indoor coil is the evaporator.
